## Farm Manuals Mangement System

### Project Overview
Since the early 1960’s, the Farm Management group at Lincoln University has been offering a series of Farm Financial Budget and Technical Manuals for the NZ farming community. The manuals have been historically extremely popular and become the Farm Management bible for many Lincoln students, graduates, farmers, and more recently consultants, Valuers and Bankers.  They can be found on the office bookshelf of almost all New Zealand farmers.

The Farm Financial Budget Manual is now in its Vol 41 version and the Farm Technical Manual is in its Vol 25 version supplements include Enterprise Analysis,  and Taxation.

Education resource for staff & students at LU, as well as other Tertiary Institutes.

New Zealand farmers and rural professionals are increasingly looking for a common source of unbiased knowledge and resources in the Primary sector.

As Land Use intensifies, sustainable environmental practices to improve productivity increase; the Enterprise Analysis and Farm manuals will assist in identifying and managing these issues.
